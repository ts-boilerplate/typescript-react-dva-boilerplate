A boilerplate of typescript, react and dva, supporting HMR


## 1 Step to Get Started
Copy all following codes, paste them on your terminal, **press enter** even though terminal has started cloning.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ts-boilerplate/typescript-react-dva-boilerplate.git
cd typescript-react-dva-boilerplate
npm install
npm start
```

> Note: `package.json` only consists of 2 basic properties: `devDependencies` and `scripts`, other remaining properties like `name`, `description` can be added freely.  
Current `package.json`:
>```js
>{
>  "scripts": {...},
>  "devDependencies": {...}
>}
>```
